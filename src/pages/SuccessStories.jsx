// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This page used to list six couples with names, cities, wedding dates, 5-star
// ratings and first-person quotes, under a stats bar claiming "2,400+ marriages",
// "96% satisfaction" and "3.2 months average to engagement". None of it was real.
// One quote specifically thanked "the chaperone mode" -- a feature that never
// worked and has since been removed.
//
// Fabricated testimonials are not a marketing shortcut. They are a false-
// advertising problem (FTC s5 for US users), they get the platform sued, and
// they poison every other number on the site: if the couples are invented, why
// should anyone believe the member count?
//
// Until real couples consent to being listed -- with their names, their own
// words, and their permission -- this page does the only honest thing available
// and explains exactly how the product behaves.

            We have not published member success stories yet. Inventing them would
            be the fastest way to look established, and the surest way to lose the
            trust this platform depends on. So instead, here is precisely how the
            product behaves.
