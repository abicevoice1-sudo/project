/**
 * seed-production-profiles.php — one-shot cPanel seeder for Shia Rishta.
 *
 * WHY A CLI SEEDER INSTEAD OF HITTING /api/auth/register
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * The live API deliberately throttles signups (php-api/index.php:110):
 *     register:ip -> 3 accounts / hour / IP
 *     write      -> 30 writes / minute / IP
 * Ten profiles would take ~4 hours of wall-clock and still produce LOCKED
 * accounts: profiles.php:397 gates full profile views behind
 * requireVerifiedEmail(), and the only way to satisfy that is the emailed
 * token — which cannot be delivered to @example.com placeholders.
 *
 * This script writes the same rows the API would, but directly, so the seed is
 * genuinely browsable: email_verified = 1 and visibility = 'public'.
 *
 * IT LIVES IN scripts/, WHICH THE DEPLOY NEVER SHIPS.
 * .github/workflows/deploy.yml pushes only ./dist/ and ./php-api/, so this file
 * cannot reach public_html and cannot be executed by a visitor. Upload it to
 * your cPanel home dir (NOT public_html) and run it from cPanel Terminal.
 *
 * USAGE (cPanel Terminal, from the repo root):
 *     php scripts/seed-production-profiles.php --dry-run
 *     php scripts/seed-production-profiles.php --purge
 *     php scripts/seed-production-profiles.php --seed
 *     php scripts/seed-production-profiles.php --all
 *
 * Requires PHP CLI + the pdo_mysql extension. Re-runnable: --seed is idempotent
 * (it updates an existing profile by email instead of inserting a duplicate).

//     pass, or run `--purge` alone to clear everything and seed later.

//     the ~50 empty shells that accumulated from E2E runs and which are
//     currently served to every signed-in member on /profiles.
//
// Child rows are deleted before parents in the same order as authDeleteAccount()
